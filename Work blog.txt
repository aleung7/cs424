\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Week February 17-22\

\b0 \ulnone On February 22, we had a meeting discussing the different roles amongst our group. Alan is working on the timeline graph of the visualization, I am creating the map of the visualization, and Eric is getting the data off of the website. In terms of a public web server, we are using Alan\'92s web server to host our project. As of now, we have an HTML parser that grabs only the data in the tables.\

\b0 \ulnone I was able to get a US map and a world map, both of which are json files. I was planning to use topojson to generate the files, but there were some issues on the accessing the files, one of which was that the topojson files were in a directory that I could not have access to.}
